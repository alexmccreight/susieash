\arguments{
\item{X}{An n by p matrix of covariates.}

\item{y}{The observed responses, a vector of length n.}

\item{L}{Maximum number of non-zero effects in the susie
regression model. If L is larger than the number of covariates, p,
L is set to p.}

\item{scaled_prior_variance}{The prior variance, divided by
\code{var(y)} (or by \code{(1/(n-1))yty} for
\code{susie_suff_stat}); that is, the prior variance of each
non-zero element of b is \code{var(y) * scaled_prior_variance}. The
value provided should be either a scalar or a vector of length
\code{L}. If \code{estimate_prior_variance = TRUE}, this provides
initial estimates of the prior variances.}

\item{residual_variance}{Variance of the residual. If
\code{estimate_residual_variance = TRUE}, this value provides the
initial estimate of the residual variance. By default, it is set to
\code{var(y)} in \code{susie} and \code{(1/(n-1))yty} in
\code{susie_suff_stat}.}

\item{prior_weights}{A vector of length p, in which each entry
gives the prior probability that corresponding column of X has a
nonzero effect on the outcome, y.}

\item{null_weight}{Prior probability of no effect (a number between
0 and 1, and cannot be exactly 1).}

\item{standardize}{If \code{standardize = TRUE}, standardize the
columns of X to unit variance prior to fitting (or equivalently
standardize XtX and Xty to have the same effect). Note that
\code{scaled_prior_variance} specifies the prior on the
coefficients of X \emph{after} standardization (if it is
performed). If you do not standardize, you may need to think more
carefully about specifying \code{scaled_prior_variance}. Whatever
your choice, the coefficients returned by \code{coef} are given for
\code{X} on the original input scale. Any column of \code{X} that
has zero variance is not standardized.}

\item{intercept}{If \code{intercept = TRUE}, the intercept is
fitted; it \code{intercept = FALSE}, the intercept is set to
zero. Setting \code{intercept = FALSE} is generally not
recommended.}

\item{estimate_residual_variance}{If
\code{estimate_residual_variance = TRUE}, the residual variance is
estimated, using \code{residual_variance} as an initial value. If
\code{estimate_residual_variance = FALSE}, the residual variance is
fixed to the value supplied by \code{residual_variance}.}

\item{estimate_prior_variance}{If \code{estimate_prior_variance =
TRUE}, the prior variance is estimated (this is a separate
parameter for each of the L effects). If provided,
\code{scaled_prior_variance} is then used as an initial value for
the optimization. When \code{estimate_prior_variance = FALSE}, the
prior variance for each of the L effects is determined by the
value supplied to \code{scaled_prior_variance}.}

\item{estimate_prior_method}{The method used for estimating prior
variance. When \code{estimate_prior_method = "simple"} is used, the
likelihood at the specified prior variance is compared to the
likelihood at a variance of zero, and the setting with the larger
likelihood is retained.}

\item{check_null_threshold}{When the prior variance is estimated,
compare the estimate with the null, and set the prior variance to
zero unless the log-likelihood using the estimate is larger by this
threshold amount. For example, if you set
\code{check_null_threshold = 0.1}, this will "nudge" the estimate
towards zero when the difference in log-likelihoods is small. A
note of caution that setting this to a value greater than zero may
lead the IBSS fitting procedure to occasionally decrease the ELBO.}

\item{prior_tol}{When the prior variance is estimated, compare the
estimated value to \code{prior_tol} at the end of the computation,
and exclude a single effect from PIP computation if the estimated
prior variance is smaller than this tolerance value.}

\item{residual_variance_upperbound}{Upper limit on the estimated
residual variance. It is only relevant when
\code{estimate_residual_variance = TRUE}.}

\item{s_init}{A previous susie fit with which to initialize.}

\item{coverage}{A number between 0 and 1 specifying the
\dQuote{coverage} of the estimated confidence sets.}

\item{min_abs_corr}{Minimum absolute correlation allowed in a
credible set. The default, 0.5, corresponds to a squared
correlation of 0.25, which is a commonly used threshold for
genotype data in genetic studies.}

\item{median_abs_corr}{An alternative "purity" threshold for the CS. Median
correlation between pairs of variables in a CS less than this
threshold will be filtered out and not reported. When both min_abs_corr
and median_abs_corr are set, a CS will only be removed if it fails both
filters. Default set to NULL to be compatible with Wang et al (2020) JRSS-B
but it is recommended to set it to 0.8 in practice.}

\item{compute_univariate_zscore}{If \code{compute_univariate_zscore
= TRUE}, the univariate regression z-scores are outputted for each
variable.}

\item{na.rm}{Drop any missing values in y from both X and y.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of IBSS iterations to perform.}

\item{tol}{A small, non-negative number specifying the convergence
tolerance for the IBSS fitting procedure. The fitting procedure
will halt when the difference in the variational lower bound, or
\dQuote{ELBO} (the objective function to be maximized), is
less than \code{tol}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{verbose = TRUE}, the algorithm's progress,
and a summary of the optimization settings, are printed to the
console.}

\item{track_fit}{If \code{track_fit = TRUE}, \code{trace}
is also returned containing detailed information about the
estimates at each iteration of the IBSS fitting procedure.}

\item{residual_variance_lowerbound}{Lower limit on the estimated
residual variance. It is only relevant when
\code{estimate_residual_variance = TRUE}.}

\item{refine}{If \code{refine = TRUE}, then an additional
iterative refinement procedure is used, after the IBSS algorithm,
to check and escape from local optima (see details).}

\item{n_purity}{Passed as argument \code{n_purity} to
\code{\link{susie_get_cs}}.}

\item{warm_start}{The number of warmstart start iterations.}
